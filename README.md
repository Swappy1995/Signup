## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
This is my Login And Registration Page Internship project which I demonstrates with my abilities in 
building a completely Full Stack project using Full Stack Technologies Like Using
JDBC, MYSQL, JSP, Servlets , Tomcat Server. Using Eclipse Java IDE Where I Created
a Dynamic Web Project and Add Tomacat Server and Mysql Connector On It and 
Used JDBC Code Connect MySQL Database Which I Created Using SQLyog App .

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
To create a login and registration page using JSP, Servlet, MySQL, and JDBC, you will need to follow the steps below:

1.Install and configure Apache Tomcat web server on your local machine.

2.Install and configure MySQL database server on your local machine.

3.Create a new database in MySQL for the login and registration page application.

4.Create a user table in the database with columns for username, password, email, and any other required fields.

5.Create a JSP page for the login form that contains input fields for username and password, and a submit button.

6.Create a Servlet to handle the login form submission. In the servlet, validate the user's credentials by checking if the username and password match those in the database. If the user's credentials are valid, redirect them to the homepage of the application. If the credentials are invalid, display an error message and ask the user to try again.

7.Create a JSP page for the registration form that contains input fields for username, password, email, and any other required fields, and a submit button.

8.Create a Servlet to handle the registration form submission. In the servlet, validate the user's input and check if the username and email are unique. If they are, insert the user's information into the database and redirect them to the homepage of the application. If they are not unique, display an error message and ask the user to try again.

9.Use JDBC to connect to the MySQL database in both the login and registration servlets.

10.Deploy the application to the Tomcat web server and test it.
### Prerequisites
1. Download Apache Tomcat 9.0
ÔÇ∑ Go to Internet Search Appache Tomcat 9 on Google Using Apache 
Website Download Apache Tomacat 9
ÔÇ∑ Go to Eclipse When Create Web Project Select Apache Tomcat 9 
and Select Folder we have downloaded browse it and add then click 
on Finish.

```
Download Software
```

### Installing

-Install and configure Apache Tomcat web server and MySQL database server on your local machine.
-Create a new database in MySQL for the login and registration page application.
-Import the provided JDBC driver into your project.

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>
To use the Signup Web Page, simply navigate to the registration page and enter user personal information, including your name, email address, and password. Once submitted, user information will be stored in the database, and user will be redirected to the sign-in page. On the sign-in page, enter your email address and password to access your account.
-Navigate to the login page and enter your credentials to log in.
-If you don't have an account, navigate to the registration page and create a new account.
-After logging in or registering, you will be redirected to the homepage of the application.
