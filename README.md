## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
This is my Login And Registration Page Internship project which I demonstrates with my abilities in 
building a completely Full Stack project using Full Stack Technologies Like Using
JDBC, MYSQL, JSP, Servlets , Tomcat Server. Using Eclipse Java IDE Where I Created
a Dynamic Web Project and Add Tomacat Server and Mysql Connector On It and 
Used JDBC Code Connect MySQL Database Which I Created Using SQLyog App .

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
To create a login and registration page using JSP, Servlet, MySQL, and JDBC, you will need to follow the steps below:

1.Install and configure Apache Tomcat web server on your local machine.

2.Install and configure MySQL database server on your local machine.

3.Create a new database in MySQL for the login and registration page application.

4.Create a user table in the database with columns for username, password, email, and any other required fields.

5.Create a JSP page for the login form that contains input fields for username and password, and a submit button.

6.Create a Servlet to handle the login form submission. In the servlet, validate the user's credentials by checking if the username and password match those in the database. If the user's credentials are valid, redirect them to the homepage of the application. If the credentials are invalid, display an error message and ask the user to try again.

7.Create a JSP page for the registration form that contains input fields for username, password, email, and any other required fields, and a submit button.

8.Create a Servlet to handle the registration form submission. In the servlet, validate the user's input and check if the username and email are unique. If they are, insert the user's information into the database and redirect them to the homepage of the application. If they are not unique, display an error message and ask the user to try again.

9.Use JDBC to connect to the MySQL database in both the login and registration servlets.

10.Deploy the application to the Tomcat web server and test it.
### Prerequisites
To run this application, you will need:

1.Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or higher
2.Apache Tomcat version 8 or higher
3.MySQL database server


### Installing

-Install and configure Apache Tomcat web server and MySQL database server on your local machine.
-Create a new database in MySQL for the login and registration page application.
-Import the provided JDBC driver into your project.

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>
1.Install MySQL on your system and create a database for your project.
2.Download and install a Java Development Kit (JDK) on your system if you haven't already.
3.Download and install an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Java, such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.
4.Create a new Java web project in your IDE.
5.Add the required JSP and servlet libraries to your project's classpath.
6.Create the necessary JSP pages for your login and registration forms.
7.Write the servlets to handle the form submissions and interact with the MySQL database using JDBC.
8.Configure your MySQL database connection in your project.
9.Run your project in your local server and test the login and registration functionality.


## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>
1.Open a web browser and navigate to the URL where you deployed the application.
2.Click the "Register" link to create a new account.
3.Enter your username, email address, and password and click the "Register" button.
4.Log in to the application using your username and password.
5.You should be redirected to a welcome page that displays your username.
## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>
This is a web application that provides a login and registration page. Users can register for an account by providing a username, email address, and password. Once registered, users can log in to the application using their username and password.
